# Bake the Starter Kits into the image.
#
# A kit is a product in a folder: the Harness it needs, and a UI that talks to that Harness as its
# backend. Both come from HarnessRouter/starter-kit, pulled and BUILT here so a launch is instant
# and works on a box with no network — the same reasoning as the skills bundle, and the same
# shape, so there is one way to add content to this image rather than two.
#
# kits.json at the repo root says which folders ship. Each kit's own kit.json says everything
# else, next to the code it describes.
