// BFF proxy to the Harness Gateway (ACA), same-origin /api/harness/* -> gateway.
//
// The gateway's OpenAI Responses-compatible /v1 surface authenticates either by a public
// per-org Bearer API key OR by an internal trust header (the web app, already behind the engine
// JWT). The browser is the latter: this BFF injects X-Harness-Internal (HARNESS_INTERNAL_KEY,
// server-only) and forwards the caller's org/member (X-Harness-Org / X-Harness-Member) so the
// gateway resolves the principal without the browser ever holding the internal key.
//
// SSE responses (text/event-stream from /v1/responses?stream) stream through unbuffered so the
// Workbench gets live reasoning/tool/text deltas instead of one blob at turn end.
//   HARNESS_GATEWAY_URL   e.g. https://harness-gateway.<env>.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io
//   HARNESS_INTERNAL_KEY  internal trust key (matches the gateway's secret)
//
// SELF-HOSTED: there is no login, so there is no JWT to gate the key on. The BFF is instead the
// only thing that can reach the gateway (it is bound to the container's loopback, and only this
// UI's port is published), so it presents the key on its own and PINS org/member from server
// constants — a request from the browser cannot claim an identity this box doesn't have.
