// The gate for a self-hosted instance that anyone can reach.
//
// Self-hosted has no accounts service, and on a machine only you can reach that is the right
// answer — a login would be ceremony with nothing behind it. The moment the box has a public URL
// that stops being true: the console creates harnesses, reads every task transcript, and runs an
// agent with your provider key. So exposure needs a gate, and the gate ships INSIDE the image
// rather than in whatever proxy happens to sit in front, because `docker run -p 3000:3000` on a
// cloud host must be safe by default and not by configuration.
//
// Middleware is the chokepoint deliberately: pages, the /api/harness proxy, static assets and any
// route added later all pass through here, so no individual handler can forget to check.
//
//   HR_AUTH_USER / HR_AUTH_PASSWORD   the initial credentials. Defaults are published in the
//                                     README, so an instance still running them is open to
//                                     anyone who read it. Change them here or on the profile
//                                     page, which stores them on the data volume and wins.
//   HR_AUTH_DISABLED=1                no gate at all. Only for a box nobody else can reach.
