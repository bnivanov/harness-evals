// This is the SAME console the hosted product runs — same components, same styles, same API
// client. It is not a fork or a reimplementation, because two consoles that drift are two
// products, and the whole point of open-core is that they are one.
//
// What differs self-hosted is only what a single box HAS. There is no accounts service, so there
// is no login; no billing service, so there are no credits; no marketplace and no analytics
// pipeline, so those surfaces have nothing behind them. Rather than delete that code (which is
// how a fork starts), this flag hides the surfaces whose backend isn't present. The routes still
// exist and still compile — they simply aren't reachable from the navigation.
//
// Set at build time so it can be tree-shaken and so a self-hosted image can never accidentally
// present a hosted-only surface.
