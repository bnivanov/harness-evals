  // client bundle from this value at build time. The Dockerfile sets it too; nothing set it for
  // `npm run dev`, so running the console locally rendered the HOSTED sign-in — an email field, a
  // password reset, and a "Create one" button pointing at an accounts service no single box has.
  // The first thing a new contributor saw was a form that cannot work, and a build that loses the
  // flag SHIPS that form: an instance once went out with a sign-in nobody could pass.
  //
  // Still an override, not a constant, because the same source also builds the hosted console.
