# Support matrix suite

Drives the console as one user and, for every harness and every model its menu offers, runs five
scenarios in one session: a first turn, a follow-up, a switch to another model of the harness (then
back), an artifact (a file the task must produce, checked on the transcript's file cards), and a
recycle (the session's sandbox is let go on purpose through the internal recycle route, then a
follow-up must recall the first message: the history survived the checkpoint round trip).
Results are one JSON record per harness x model with the outcome, seconds and reason of each
scenario; `fill-connection.py` stamps each record with the connection its session actually ran on;
`render.py` turns the records into `docs/support-matrix.md`.

```
export BASE=https://your-instance HR_USER=harnessrouter HR_PASS=... PROVIDER=tokenrouter

```

Needs `playwright` (`npm i playwright` next to `run.mjs`, then `npx playwright install chromium`).
Resumable: a pair already recorded is skipped, so a killed worker is relaunched and continues; a
pair whose record carries `error` (the runner's own failure) is re-run. To re-run failed pairs,
delete their records and relaunch. `PROVIDER` is a label for the table: run once per provider, with the model map pointing every
model that provider serves at its integration (one provider at a time, since a model has one
integration). `MODELS` (comma list) limits a run
to some models, which is how a single failing pair is reproduced with tracing on. Set
`IGNORE_TLS=1` for an instance on a self-signed certificate.

Rows that fail must carry the reproduced provider error text; a verified list is never inherited
from another instance, since each reaches providers by its own path. Retest a bare `incomplete`
before excluding a model.
