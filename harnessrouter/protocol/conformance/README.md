# UHP conformance suite

**Passing this suite is what "UHP conformant" means.** Not implementing the endpoints, not a
self-assessment, not passing most of it. The suite is in this repository, it runs against any server
over HTTP, and anyone can run it against anyone's implementation.

## Running it

```bash
pip install -e protocol/conformance

uhp-conformance \
  --base-url https://your-uhp-server \
  --api-key "$UHP_API_KEY" \
  --class full \
  --json report.json
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--base-url` | Server root. The suite appends `/v1/...` itself. |
| `--api-key` | Bearer token, or set `UHP_API_KEY`. |
| `--class` | `core`, `extended` or `full`. Cumulative — `full` runs everything. |
| `--harness-id` | Run tasks against a specific harness instead of the first one listed. |
| `--model` | Run tasks with a specific model. |
| `--task-timeout` | Seconds to allow one agent task. Default 300. |
| `--only` | Comma-separated check ids, for iterating on one failure. |
| `--json` | Write a machine-readable report. |
| `--plain` | No ANSI colour, for CI logs. |

Exit code is `0` when nothing failed and `1` otherwise, so it drops into CI unchanged.

**The suite runs real agent tasks.** It sends about six of them, which costs real model tokens and a
few minutes. That is deliberate: the defects worth catching — a stream that never flushes, a
cancellation that never terminates, an artifact that cannot be downloaded — are invisible to
anything that only inspects a schema.

## What it checks

64 checks across three classes.

| Class | Checks | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | 40 | Discovery, version negotiation, authentication, the error envelope, harnesses, models, task execution (streaming and not), the event stream, sessions, cancellation, reserved request fields |
| **Extended** | +8 | Session listing and inspection, file input, artifacts, download headers, path-traversal probes |
| **Full** | +15 | Harness create / update / delete, refusal of an unsupported base, skill-folder round trip, MCP and disabled-tool persistence, session sharing |

Every check names the section of the specification it enforces, so a failure points at the sentence
it violates rather than at a test name.

A few of them are worth calling out, because they catch things a schema check never will:

- **S-04** — `sequence_number` is gapless and monotonic. Without it a client cannot tell a dropped
  event from a server that simply skips numbers.
- **S-09** — the stream is progressive. It measures the spread of event arrival times and fails a
  server that buffers everything and flushes at the end. That is the single most common UHP
  deployment error, it is usually a proxy setting, and it is indistinguishable from a slow agent
  unless something measures it.
- **C-03** — a running task really stops. It starts long work, cancels it, and waits for a terminal
  state. A cancel endpoint that returns `200` and leaves the agent running passes every other kind
  of test.
- **X-07** — artifacts download with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Artifacts are
  attacker-influenceable content; served without it, an artifact is stored XSS against the client's
  own origin.
- **X-08** — artifact ids do not traverse out of their container. Probes for `../` and its
  percent-encoded form.
- **T-08/T-09/T-10** — the reserved fields `tools` and `include` are accepted, and reported as
  ignored. Both halves matter: before these, the suite sent neither field, so a server that
  rejected them outright and a server that silently acted on them scored the same as a correct
  one. T-10 covers the third mistake, a server that reports fields the request never sent.
- **R-01…R-08** — session sharing, which is mostly a set of refusals. Sessions §5 requires that a
  shared view be read-only, revocable, and free of credentials, and a check that merely opens a
  link and reads the conversation passes against a server that also lets that link continue the
  task, cancel the run, or upload into the working directory. §5 makes sharing optional, so these
  skip rather than fail on a server that does not implement it. Since §5 named the share object's
  `url` and `DELETE` on the mint endpoint, `R-01`, `R-02` and `R-06` assert both rather than
  discovering them — they used to skip with the missing sentence as the reason.
  `tests/test_session_sharing_checks.py` runs the series against a deliberately wrong server, one
  defect at a time, so each of them is known to fail on the mistake it describes.
- **R-08** — a bodyless `POST` publishes. The series mints through a helper that retries a 400/422
  with `{"enabled": true}`, because a server speaking only that dialect would otherwise skip all
  seven of the checks above — so the retry is what makes the series portable, and it is also what
  hides this sentence: a toggle-only server passes `R-01`…`R-07` on the strength of a request §5
  does not require anyone to accept, while refusing the one it does. `R-08` is the one check that
  does not retry. Its stub defect, `bodyless_rejected`, is what the reference implementation was
  before this series existed.
- **F-03/F-04** — a skill is a folder, and it survives an unrelated edit. A server that stores only
  `SKILL.md`, or that empties a bundle when the harness is renamed, passes every other check: the
  config still looks right, and the loss only shows up later as an agent behaving oddly.

## Outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **PASS** | The required behaviour was observed. |
| **FAIL** | The behaviour was observed to be wrong. A conformance defect. |
| **SKIP** | The check could not run, with the reason recorded. |
| **ERROR** | The check itself broke — a bug in the suite. |

**A skip is never a pass.** The report states skips separately and repeats that they were not
verified, because a suite that hides unrun checks behind a green summary is how a suite starts
lying about the thing it exists to establish.

The JSON report holds itself to the same rule, because it is the artifact published as evidence
for a conformance claim and its reader is frequently not the person who ran it:

- `conformant` is `true` only when every check ran and none failed or errored. A single skip
  makes it `false`.
- `conformant_with_skips` is `true` when nothing failed or errored — the checks that ran are
  clean, and the ones that didn't are enumerated in `skipped_not_verified` by id, so the report
  says exactly what it did not establish.
- `suite_version` and `generated_at` (UTC) tie the report to the suite revision and the moment
  that produced it. A report without these fields predates suite `2026.8.11.post1`; the
  checked-in reports from earlier runs are of that older shape.

## Reference implementation results

<!-- conformance-recorded-run:start — regenerated by .github/workflows/conformance-remeasure.yml; do not edit by hand -->
HarnessRouter Community Edition, the reference implementation in this repository, run against a
live instance on 2026-09-04 (suite 2026.8.11.post1):

```
  Summary
    64/64 passed · 0 failed · 0 skipped · 0 errored
    CONFORMANT — UHP 2026-08-11 (full)
```
<!-- conformance-recorded-run:end -->

Both new series were measured against the reference implementation directly, live on a
self-hosted instance, and both measured a real defect before passing:

- `R-01`…`R-07` all pass. Against the reference as it stood, all seven skipped (its share
  dialect wanted `{"enabled": true}` and published no view URL), and behind those skips sat a
  real Sessions §6 violation: a session's share link kept serving the full conversation after
  `DELETE /v1/traces/{id}`, verified live before the fix.
- `T-08`–`T-10` pass, with `T-09` failing against the reference as it stood: `tools` fed the
  idempotency hash and nothing reported it ignored — the silent drop §1.1 now forbids.

A suite that had shipped happy-path checks would have called that server conformant both times.

`R-08` was added afterwards, from a gap the PR that closed those two named in its own body rather
than left to be found: *"a body is OPTIONAL; no body means publish" has no dedicated check yet.*
It passes against the reference and against an independent Go implementation (63/63 `full`, zero
skipped, on the latter). Neither server can currently fail it — which is the argument for the
check, not against it: two implementations agreeing by coincidence is what a specification
sentence is supposed to stop being true by, and nothing in either tree would have noticed one of
them stopping.

The suite is developed against that implementation, which is exactly why the specification says
conformance is defined by the suite and not by the implementation: anything the reference does that
the suite does not require is a HarnessRouter behaviour, not a UHP requirement, and another
implementation is free to do it differently.

Writing and running the suite found four real defects, three in the reference implementation and one
in the suite itself:

1. No capability discovery at all — a client had to guess or learn from a `404`.
2. No protocol version on the wire.
3. Failures returned a bare human string, so a client had to match on prose to decide whether to
   retry.
4. `POST /v1/harnesses` accepted a base the server could not run, deferring the failure to the first
   task — after the client had committed to it. Caught by **F-02** on the first full run.

Testing the tool and skill surface against live agents found three more, none of which any
config-level check would have seen:

5. **Hermes could not use HTTP MCP servers at all.** The image installed an unpinned `mcp` SDK,
   which resolved to a version that removed the symbol Hermes gates HTTP transport on. Every remote
   MCP server configured for that backend was silently dropped, and the agent replied "I can't
   access that tool" — indistinguishable from a model refusal. The SDK is now pinned, verified on
   start-up, and repaired in place on volumes that already have the broken version.
6. **Hermes ignored `disabledTools` entirely.** Claude enforces them with a hard flag and Codex
   receives them as an instruction; Hermes had neither branch, so an operator who disabled a tool
   got no enforcement and no warning.
7. **The MCP URL policy was advisory.** It ran only on the console's "Test connection" button, so
   the console refused a URL that a turn then connected to anyway. It is now one function applied at
   both config time and run time.
8. **Claude's hard block was a no-op, and the product claimed it was hard.** Disabled tools were
   passed as `--disallowedTools`, which belongs to the permission-prompt system — and autonomous
   runs pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which turns that system off. The flag was accepted
   and ignored, so an operator who disabled `Bash` watched the agent run `Bash`. The restriction is
   now written into the runtime's settings file as a deny rule, which the skip-permissions flag does
   not override. Proven both ways against a live agent: with the tool enabled it ran the command;
   with it disabled the agent reported having no such tool and did not run it.

### What these checks do not establish

The suite verifies that `disabledTools` **persists**, not that it is **enforced**. Enforcement is
deliberately not checked, because §4.3 permits instruction-level enforcement, and an agent that
obeys an instruction is indistinguishable over HTTP from a runtime that blocks the tool — so a
behavioural check would pass a server whose block does nothing whenever the model happened to
comply. Defect 8 was a no-op block that a behavioural check would have called conformant on most
runs. Enforcement is verified against the runtime, by disabling a tool and asserting the agent never
invokes it, and it belongs in an implementation's own test suite rather than here.

## Adding a check

A check is a function that asserts one requirement:

```python
@check("T-08", "Tasks reject an empty input", "core", f"{SPEC}/tasks.md#2-input")
def t08(ctx):
    r = ctx.client.post("/v1/responses", body={"input": ""})
    assert r.status == 400, f"empty input returned HTTP {r.status}, expected 400"
```

Rules for a good check:

- **Assert what the specification says, not what the reference implementation does.** Where the
  specification allows latitude, the check must allow it too — otherwise the suite enforces one
  implementation's preferences and every other implementation fails for being different rather than
  for being wrong.
- **Fail with the evidence.** The message should say what was expected, what happened, and why it
  matters. `assert r.status == 200` tells a maintainer nothing.
- **Skip loudly, never silently.** If a precondition is missing, `raise Skip("reason")`.
- **Clean up.** A check that creates a harness deletes it, including when it fails.

Per [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md), a specification change is not complete until a check enforces
it — a rule nothing tests is a wish.
