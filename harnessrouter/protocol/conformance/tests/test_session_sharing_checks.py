"""The R-series is tested the way it asks servers to be tested: by being shown to fail.

Sessions §5 is mostly a list of refusals, and a check that only ever passes cannot tell a
server that refuses from one that does not — D-05 passed against real servers for months while
being vacuous, which is the failure this file exists to avoid repeating.

So every R- check is run against a deliberately wrong server (share_defect_stub.py) carrying
one defect at a time. Each defect must be caught by the check that claims to cover it, and a
clean server must pass all seven. The stub answers every task itself, so this needs no
credentials, no network and no agent tokens.
