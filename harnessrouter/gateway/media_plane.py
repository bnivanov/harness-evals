"""Making a picture, a clip, a line of speech — and assembling them into one film.

Two callers, one engine, one place the provider key is resolved:

  * the `media` MCP server this gateway hosts, so an agent can ask for a CAPABILITY
    (text_to_video, text_to_image, …) and be told which model actually ran;
  * the routes a media app calls to read its canvas, poll its jobs and export a film.

WHAT NEVER LEAVES THIS PROCESS. The provider key is resolved from the integrations document
inside the gateway, at the moment of use. The runner never receives it (an agent gets a per-turn
capability, never a key), and neither does the browser. Same shape the database server already
uses, for the same reason: a sandbox runs a customer's agent with real bash and egress.

THE AGENT NEVER NAMES A MODEL. It names a capability; this module walks that capability's ordered
candidate list and returns the first one that can actually serve the request — provider connected,
parameters honourable, not watermarked unless asked, not quarantined by a recent billable failure —
and the caller reports which one it was. Four video models are listed and two of them are broken;
that is the whole reason this exists rather than a model id in a tool argument.

SEVEN ENDPOINT SHAPES, all measured against the live accounts on 2026-08-15:

  video-generation   POST /video/generations -> task id; GET /video/generations/{id} to poll
  image-generation   POST /images/generations -> b64_json OR url (both occur)
  openai             POST /chat/completions -> choices[0].message.images[0].image_url.url
  gemini             POST /v1beta/models/{id}:generateContent -> inlineData parts
  audio-chat         POST /chat/completions with modalities -> message.audio.data (+ transcript)
  elevenlabs-music   POST /music -> RAW AUDIO BYTES
  elevenlabs-speech  POST /text-to-speech/{voice_id} -> RAW AUDIO BYTES

THE LAST TWO BREAK WHAT THE FIRST FIVE SHARE, and each break is a place a special case could have
gone. The auth header is not a bearer, and which header a provider wants is declared BESIDE ITS
BASE URL in the catalog — see `auth_of` — rather than branched on its name where the socket is.
The answer is not JSON, and the same endpoint answers audio when it worked and JSON when it did
not, so a response is CLASSIFIED before it is read — see `response_doc`. And the model is a PATH
SEGMENT, not a body field, which is why `voice_for` computes the answer in one place: what the URL
carries and what the tool reports afterwards cannot be allowed to disagree.

They are TWO shapes and not one because a shape IS an endpoint's identity here, and these are two
endpoints: different path, different body, different tunables. `_SHAPE_TUNABLES` is the whitelist a
candidate is held to when it declares no `params` of its own, and each of these lists is exactly
what its builder emits — merge them and the whitelist permits four fields where the endpoint has
two, which is a whitelist that has stopped describing what it guards. Merging would also need the
one branch to pick a path from some new catalog field, which is two shapes wearing one name. What
they genuinely share is shared rather than copied: one auth entry, one raw-response branch.

"200 OK" IS NOT SUCCESS. A candidate has only run once its response carries an actual media
payload. google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview answers 200 with `parts: []` and bills ~1356 tokens;
it is excluded from every chain, and this rule exists so its siblings cannot do the same quietly.

NEVER FORWARD AN UNRECOGNISED PARAMETER. The relay ignores unknown fields and submits the job
anyway, so a typo costs a full-price generation. Each candidate declares `params`, and the request
builders emit nothing outside that set — see `build_submit`, which hands back exactly which
tunables it used so a test can assert the subset rather than trust the code.

# ── the aspect ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# AN ASPECT IS A SIZE, everywhere in this catalog. Nothing here honours an `aspect_ratio` field —
# MiniMax is measured ignoring one and billing anyway — so the only lever any candidate has is the
# `size` parameter it already declares, and there is no new per-candidate key for aspects at all.
# Three facts already in the file answer the whole question:
#
#   `params` lists `size`   -> it can be TOLD a shape. That list is this file's statement of which
#                              tunables a model honours; MiniMax's deliberately omits `size` and
#                              says why in its note, so reading that list IS reading a measurement.
#   `resolution` and no     -> it IS one shape and cannot be told another. Its aspect is arithmetic
#   `size` in params           on a frame that was already measured, never a second hand-written
#                              field that could disagree with the first.

#                              measure it" and "it will be fine" are not the same sentence.
