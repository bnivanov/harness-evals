"""An incomplete turn says WHY, and only when it knows.

One banner for every incomplete — "hit its step or time limit" — misdiagnosed a turn that was
cut by a deploy restart, and sent the operator debugging a 400-step default that was never
reached. The record now carries incomplete_details.reason (max_steps | timeout | interrupted);
absent means unknown, and the console claims nothing specific.
